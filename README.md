# Welcome to CodigoDelSur Node tech challenge

To set up the app you will need Node 18 on your environment. You will also need an API testing platform (we recommend Postman but you are free to use any platform of your choice) 

## Setup instructions
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run seed`
- Run `npm run dev`
- In the API platform make a GET request to http://localhost:3000 and get a welcome message to confirm the server is running

The app includes a file with some mock data. You can find it under `src/config/seed.js`
